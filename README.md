# HeartyAI: Deciphering Heart Disease Patterns
Project Summary: Analysis of Classification Algorithms for Heart Disease Prediction

1\. Problem Statement: The primary objective of this project is to utilize machine learning to predict whether a patient has heart disease based on clinical parameters. It involves evaluating various classification algorithms to identify the most accurate model for this binary classification task.

2\. Data Source: The original dataset was sourced from the Cleavland dataset, available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This dataset encompasses a comprehensive range of clinical features and patient characteristics relevant to heart disease prediction.

3\. Evaluation Metric: The primary evaluation metric chosen for model selection is "precision." Precision is especially important in healthcare applications as it measures the accuracy of positive predictions, minimizing false positives, and ensuring reliable diagnoses.

4\. Features (Data Dictionary): The dataset includes a variety of clinical parameters and patient attributes:

-   Age in years
-   Gender (1 for male, 0 for female)
-   Chest pain type (with corresponding codes)
-   Resting blood pressure
-   Serum cholesterol levels
-   Fasting blood sugar levels
-   Resting electrocardiographic results
-   Maximum heart rate achieved
-   Exercise-induced angina
-   ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
-   The slope of the peak exercise ST segment
-   The number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy
-   Thalium stress test results
-   Target variable indicating the presence of heart disease (1 for yes, 0 for no)

5\. Model Scores:

-   Logistic Regression: Precision of approximately 0.8852
-   K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Precision of approximately 0.6885
-   Random Forest: Precision of approximately 0.8361

6\. Detailed Model Evaluation:

-   Logistic Regression, with optimized hyperparameters (C=0.2043, solver="liblinear"), was identified as the most accurate model.
-   Cross-validated metrics for the Logistic Regression model:
    -   Average Accuracy: 0.8447
    -   Average Precision: 0.8208
    -   Average Recall: 0.9212
    -   Average F1-Score: 0.8673
-   Visualizations of these cross-validated metrics further support the model's effectiveness.

7\. Conclusion: In conclusion, the Logistic Regression algorithm is the best-suited machine learning model for the binary classification problem of predicting heart disease. It achieved high precision and recall, making it a valuable tool for assisting healthcare professionals in diagnosing heart disease accurately. However, ongoing monitoring and further evaluation in real-world healthcare settings are essential considerations.

This project demonstrates the potential of machine learning in healthcare applications and its ability to enhance medical decision-making processes.
